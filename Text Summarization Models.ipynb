In PEGASUS, several whole sentences are removed from documents during pre-training, and the model is tasked with recovering them. The Input for such pre-training is a document with missing sentences, while the output consists of the missing sentences being concatenated together. The advantage of this self-supervision is that you can create as many examples as there are documents without any human intervention, which often becomes a bottleneck problem in purely supervised systems."
